  - title: Virtual Flow Metering
    body: >-
      Multiphase flowrate measurements of oil, gas, and water play an important
      role in production optimization, rate allocation and reservoir
      management.  To measure flow rates from each producing well is by
      multiphase flow meter devices not scalable as it has a high cost impact.


      Virtual Flow Metering (VFM) from Turbulent Flux is accurate and field scalable that estimate oil, gas and water flowrates produced from wells without measuring them directly. The technology is self-maintained by a hybrid physics and data driven model with unique auto-calibration routines so it will output accurate results at any point in time as the well production changes.  The VFM is field proven by multiple clients and can be expanded to also include virtual shut-in/start-up or ramp-down/ramp-up of well production.

  - title: Flow Information On Demand
    body: >-
      Flow Information On Demand from Turbulent Flux is an efficient tool to
      quickly get production flow information from wells and pipelines. With
      instant access to results can more expert time be spent on evaluating
      results instead of result preparation work. When production has a flow
      problem they will often engage a flow simulation expert. A representative
      flow model must then be prepared before reliable results can be produced.
      This can take weeks or months and is not a scalable process.


      Flow Information On Demand is developed in partnership with Aker BP that provide production flow insights into planned production, impact from system modifications, and troubleshoot production incidents. The software maps out flow effects from production slugging and system start-ups that can cause production downtime or reduce production volumes. Wells and pipeline models can upfront be easily created, modified and connected to production data in an user friendly web interface. Models can be revised and published to operations where valuable flow information can be displayed in existing production dashboards with one-click functionality. Calculated flow parameters can automatically be compared with corresponding production reference data for validation purposes.
  - title: Stable Production Advisor
    body: The Stable Production Advisor provide advice on the envelope of stable
      flow production to the user. Together with Aker BP has Turbulent Flux
      developed a product that enables the client to produce closer to
      production facility limitations and increase production output.  This will
      avoid uneccessary production choke backs or shut-ins from severe
      instabilities.
  - title: Use of API
    body: The Turbulent Flux API is very powerful as it enables our transient
      multiphase simulator to be consumed by 3rd party applications.  We have
      developed a rich REST API that gives the 3rd party full flexibility. Our
      partner Cognite AS is actively using our API to develop their own
      innovative applications that will benefit from the Turbulent Flux
      technology.
  - title: Wax Monitoring
    body: Turbulent Flux Wax Monitoring provides a real time wax deposition
      product.  The product is developed in partnership with Petronas based on
      the Turbulent Flux multiphase flow simulator.  Wax deposition varies over
      time with operations and relates to fluid compositions and operational
      changes.  The client value is to save cost by intelligent wax monitoring
      so pigging operation will only be conducted when required.
