  - title: Why we exist
    body: <p>The Oil and Gas industry stands on the edge of a new frontier. Digital transformation is continuously changing how we operate, and as digitalization increases, we expect reduced workforces to take on greater workloads. Itâ€™s expected that we deliver more and better with fewer resources.</p>
                                            <p>The best technology for production optimization has until now only been available to the happy few. Solutions are expensive and time-consuming to install; scalability is limited.</p>
                                            <p>We believe there is an alternative.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Turbulent Flux wants to take the lead on technology for production improvement, building on the idea of independence, flexibility and scalability.</strong></p>
                                            <p>We make world-leading software for flow insights accessible for everyone in our industry. We redefine how data from production is used, enabling around the clock access to real-time, high-precision insights.</p>
                                            <p>Turbulent Flux empowers the oil and gas industry to face current challenges head-on thanks to radically better utilization of data.</p>
                                            <p>Having the right information, all the time, means better decisions, all the time. We help you reap the benefits of optimized production, boosted efficiency and increased safety in your operations.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Together, we set the new standard for flow insights in our industry.</strong></p>
