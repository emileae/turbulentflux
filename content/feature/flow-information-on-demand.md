Flow Information On Demand from Turbulent Flux is an efficient tool to quickly get production flow information from wells and pipelines. With instant access to results can more expert time be spent on evaluating results instead of result preparation work. When production has a flow problem they will often engage a flow simulation expert. A representative flow model must then be prepared before reliable results can be produced. This can take weeks or months and is not a scalable process.

Flow Information On Demand is developed in partnership with Aker BP that provide production flow insights into planned production, impact from system modifications, and troubleshoot production incidents. The software maps out flow effects from production slugging and system start-ups that can cause production downtime or reduce production volumes. Wells and pipeline models can upfront be easily created, modified and connected to production data in an user friendly web interface. Models can be revised and published to operations where valuable flow information can be displayed in existing production dashboards with one-click functionality. Calculated flow parameters can automatically be compared with corresponding production reference data for validation purposes.
