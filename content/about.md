## About us ##
The Oil and Gas industry has been leveraging data for decades. Increasing digitization has added to the huge amount of data available, pouring massive amounts of sensor data onto data platforms. But strangely enough, only about 1% of the data is used for decision-purposes.

With over 50 years’ joint experience from the industry, Gjermund Weisz, Kjetil Roe, Torgeir Ruden and Lars Vollebæk knew this all too well. For years they had agonized over the quantity of incomprehensible data that no one made good use of. They had experienced first-hand how hard it is to keep an overview of the actual state of wells and pipelines. Faced with a constantly changing environment, how could single, deferred data points possibly help you gain control over your flows?

Throughout their respective careers, they observed progress. The industry started a digitization journey that presented new opportunities for gaining control and optimizing production. However, the solutions that emerged were too heavy and inflexible and did not solve the crucial pain point: operational personnel could not access real-time information to support their decisions; they did not have what they needed to make the very most of available resources.

In 2016, the four flow experts decided it was time for a change.

They knew they had the necessary expertise. They knew the technology could be built. And more than anything, they wanted to make it everything that the pre-existing solutions were not: open, affordable, flexible, scalable.

Gjermund, Kjetil, Torgeir and Lars founded Turbulent Flux with the vision to create a one-click, scalable and adaptable software that would redefine how data are used in oil and gas production. They wanted to enable better decisions for better use of resources.

Today, Turbulent Flux offers the solution the founders wished for when they were inside the industry. They provide a solution that no one else can offer, staying true to their wish to make world-leading technology accessible for everyone in the industry.
